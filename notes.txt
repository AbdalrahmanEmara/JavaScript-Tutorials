    when I want to explain upnormal thing, not explain the normal orders.

widow functions.
    1- window.alert(what you want to alert user)
        -The alert box takes the focus away from the
         current window, and forces the user to read the message.
        -Do not overuse this method. It prevents the
         user from accessing other parts of the page until the alert box is closed.
    
    // write html element from js code.
document.write("<h2>hay fai<br>fjads</h2>");

    // write message in console
console.log("hello console.");

Console Methods and styling and web api

    Console Methods
        - log (writing on console).
        - error (writing on console as an error
            and tell you in console the line for this error in js code).
        - table (show array in table in console)
            console.table([12, 22, 33]);

    Styling Console
            -Directive %c : give style for element in console and the styling is applied
                            until you give it another %c, it will change styling.
                - console.log("hello from %cjs %cfile", "color: red; font-size: 40px;", "color: blue; font-size: 40px;");
                    write on console and style it. using %c.

    Console not from javascript; but it is web api.
        and javascript uses console by his syntax.
